- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Samuel Gordon
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things but the only 2 of them are relevant here.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on 2 projects. 1 is Passive atmospheric water harvester which is an invention I am working on. You can find out about in my PAWH Aquagen repository. The other is developing web apps to help people with productivity in their work.
